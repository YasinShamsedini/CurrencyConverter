# Currency Converter - My First Non-Small Prohect in PythonüöÄ

## Introduction üìù

This is **my first non-small Python project** where I developed a **currency exchange app**. The app allows users to input an amount in one currency, select the source and target currencies, and then perform the conversion. 

I named this project "** My First Non-Small Prohect in Python**" because it‚Äôs a larger-scale project where I personally handled around **40%** of the code, and the remaining 60% was assisted by AI tools.

### Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è:
- **Currency Conversion:** Users can input an amount in one currency and convert it to another currency based on real-time exchange rates.
- **Thousands of Data Points:** The app supports converting between **thousands of different currencies** and allows for easy addition of new currencies and exchange rates, making it highly flexible.
- **CRUD for Exchange Rates:** You can **add, update, or delete** exchange rates within the app.
- **Conversion History Report:** The app keeps track of all past conversions and displays them in a **conversion history report** with the exact amount, source, and target currencies.
- **Dark Theme UI:** I‚Äôve designed the app with a **dark theme** to give it a modern look and provide a more comfortable experience, especially in low-light conditions.

The goal was to create an **intuitive, easy-to-use UI** where users can access the most important features without confusion, making the entire process of currency conversion simple and enjoyable.

## User Interface (UI) üíª

The user interface is sleek and minimal, built around a **dark theme** for a stylish appearance. The UI is designed to be **user-friendly** and simple to navigate. Here are the main UI components:

1. **Main Page:**
   - Users can **input the amount**, choose the **from currency**, and select the **to currency**.
   - The conversion result is displayed clearly below the input fields.

2. **Manage Currencies (CRUD):**
   - Users can **add, update, or delete exchange rates**.
   - The list of available exchange rates is shown in a **Treeview**, making it easy to modify and view existing data.

3. **Conversion History Report:**
   - The app generates a **conversion report** showing past conversions, including the **source and target currencies**, **amount**, and **converted amount**.
   
**UI Highlights:**
- **Responsive design**: The app adjusts well to different screen sizes, although there may be some overflow issues on smaller screens for the conversion report.
- **Clear & Accessible Navigation**: Easy-to-navigate layout with large buttons and clearly labeled fields for smooth user interaction.

## Strengths üí™

- **Comprehensive Currency Conversion:** The core functionality for converting currencies works flawlessly, with the ability to handle thousands of currencies.
- **CRUD Operations:** The system allows users to **add, modify, and remove exchange rates**, making it highly customizable.
- **Conversion History:** The app maintains a detailed **report** of all conversions, offering transparency and tracking.
- **Dark Theme UI:** Designed with a **modern dark theme**, offering a visually appealing experience that's easy on the eyes.
- **Ease of Use:** The app provides a simple and clean interface that‚Äôs easy for users to understand and navigate.

## Weaknesses ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Report Display Overflow:** The conversion history report can overflow on narrow screens. To view the entire content, the window size might need to be increased. This is something I plan to address in future updates.
- **Limited Customization Options:** While the app handles basic conversions and CRUD operations, there‚Äôs room to add more customization features like user preferences or real-time data integration with external APIs.

## Future Improvements ‚è≥

- **Responsive Report Display:** The overflow issue in the report section will be fixed to make the app fully responsive, improving the user experience on smaller screens.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Future versions will integrate live APIs for real-time currency exchange rates, making the conversions even more accurate.
- **User Authentication:** I plan to add authentication features to allow users to save their conversion history and preferences securely.
