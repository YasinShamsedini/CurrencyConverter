# Currency Converter - My First Non-Small Python Project üöÄ

## Introduction üìù

This is **my first non-small Python project**, where I developed a **currency exchange app**. The app allows users to input an amount in one currency, choose the source and target currencies, and perform the conversion.

I named this project "**My First Non-Small Project in Python**" because it's a larger-scale project where I personally wrote about **40%** of the code, and the rest (60%) was generated with the help of AI tools.

### Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è:
- **Currency Conversion:** Users can enter an amount in one currency and convert it to another currency using real-time exchange rates.
- **Support for Thousands of Currencies:** The app can handle conversions between **thousands of different currencies** and allows easy addition of new currencies and exchange rates.
- **CRUD for Exchange Rates:** You can **add, update, or delete** exchange rates in the app.
- **Conversion History Report:** The app keeps track of past conversions and displays them in a **conversion history report**, showing the original amount, source, and target currencies.
- **Dark Theme UI:** I designed the app with a **dark theme** for a modern, sleek look, and to provide a more comfortable experience, especially in low-light environments.

The goal was to create an **intuitive and easy-to-use UI**, where users can quickly access all the key features without any confusion, making the currency conversion process seamless and enjoyable.

## User Interface (UI) üíª

The UI is sleek and minimal, designed around a **dark theme** for a stylish appearance. The goal was to keep it **user-friendly** and simple. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key UI components:

1. **Main Page:**
   - Users can **input the amount**, select the **from currency**, and choose the **to currency**.
   - The conversion result is displayed clearly below the input fields.

2. **Manage Currencies (CRUD):**
   - Users can **add, update, or delete exchange rates**.
   - The available exchange rates are displayed in a **Treeview**, making it easy to manage and view the data.

3. **Conversion History Report:**
   - The app generates a **conversion history report**, showing past conversions, including **source and target currencies**, **amounts**, and **converted values**.

**UI Highlights:**
- **Responsive Design:** The app works well across different screen sizes, though there might be an overflow issue on narrower screens with the conversion history.
- **Easy Navigation:** The layout is simple to navigate, with large buttons and clearly labeled fields for smooth user interaction.

## Strengths üí™

- **Comprehensive Currency Conversion:** The core conversion functionality works flawlessly, supporting thousands of currencies.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can **add, modify, and delete exchange rates**, providing a lot of flexibility.
- **Conversion History:** The app tracks past conversions and makes it easy to access the full history.
- **Dark Theme UI:** A modern and visually appealing **dark theme** that‚Äôs easy on the eyes.
- **Ease of Use:** The app offers a simple and clean interface that‚Äôs intuitive for users to navigate.

## Weaknesses ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Report Display Overflow:** The conversion history can overflow on narrow screens. To view the full report, users may need to increase the window size. I plan to address this in future updates.
- **Limited Customization:** The app currently focuses on basic conversions and CRUD operations, but there‚Äôs room to add more customization features, like user preferences or real-time API integration.

## Future Improvements ‚è≥

- **Fix Report Overflow:** I‚Äôll address the overflow issue in the conversion history report to make the app fully responsive on all screen sizes.
- **Real-Time API Integration:** Future versions will integrate live APIs to fetch real-time exchange rates for more accurate conversions.
- **User Authentication:** I plan to add user authentication, allowing users to save their conversion history and preferences securely.
